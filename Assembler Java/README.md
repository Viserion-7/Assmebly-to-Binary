# Assmebly-to-Binary

This is the Java program to convert hack assembly to binary.
Part of [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) project 6


The programs given are the standalone version of each process to convert them.

First one is removing white spaces.

Second one is just recognising the symbols.

Third one is creating a symbol table.

Last two are standalone A and C instruction.

The final program is in the Assembler Main folder Assembler.java file.

There is also a similar file which is Assembler_modified.java which calls the methods from different files to run the program.

Thank you !!
