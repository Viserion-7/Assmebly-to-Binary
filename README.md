# Assmebly-to-Binary

This is a program to convert hack assembly to binary.
Part of [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) project 6

The program is done in two languages [Python](/Assembler Python) and [Java](Assembler Java).

The other programs given are the standalone version of each process to convert them.

First one is removing white spaces.

Second one is just recognising the symbols.

Third one is creating a symbol table.

Last two are standalone A and C instruction.

There is also the combined file to do all the steps together.

Thank you !!
